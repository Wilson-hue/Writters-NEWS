On November 17, two Russian cosmonauts ventured outside the International Space Station (ISS) for a nearly seven hour spacewalk. The walk took place for some hardware transfers and electronics connections on the International Space Station. 

In the video shared by the space station on Instagram, the cosmonauts can be seen walking in space. However, it does appear that they are floating as the Earth is seen in the background.
